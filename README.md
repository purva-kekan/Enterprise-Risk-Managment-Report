# 🧠 Enterprise Risk Management: Oracle–Cerner Acquisition

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores enterprise risk management (ERM) in the context of **Oracle's acquisition of Cerner Corporation**, a strategic move to transform the healthcare IT landscape. The report analyzes the risks associated with the merger and outlines mitigation strategies using qualitative, quantitative, and early warning methodologies.

The project was submitted as part of the **ALY 6130 – Enterprise Risk Management** course and focuses on real-world application of ERM principles, including integration risks, cybersecurity, financial and market uncertainties, and risk monitoring frameworks.
